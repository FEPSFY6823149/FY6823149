In the ever-evolving landscape of aviation, the transition from traditional mechanical linkages to fly-by-wire systems marks a
paradigm shift. This electrical interpretation of a pilot's inputs not only eliminates cumbersome rod and pulley setups but
also revolutionizes aircraft maneuverability by seamlessly integrating pilot commands with external factors. The advantages
of fly-by-wire are limitless, including enhanced safety through the prevention of pilot errors and improved passenger comfort
during turbulence.

 <h2 id=Introduction>Introduction</h2>
    <pre>
Stepping into the future of aviation we find a reality where a pilot's slightest movement of the control stick translates into a
graceful turn or a swift ascent, not through traditional mechanical linkages, but via an intricate complexion of electrical
signals. 
The fly by wire system is an electrical interpretation of the mechanical inputs from a pilot. The system will process mechanical
inputs and transform them into an electrical signal for each flight control surface to read. <a href="#Nicolin">(Nicolin & Nicolin, 2019).</a>.
This technology isn't just about translation, however; it's about orchestrating maneuvers. By blending pilot commands with
external factors like plane speed and altitude, the system calculates and executes optimal maneuvers seamlessly. Beyond its
weight reduction benefits achieved by eliminating archaic rod and pulley setups, the fly-by-wire innovation stands as a
cornerstone of safer and more comfortable flights.

<h2 id=History>History of fly by wire</h2>
  <pre>
The journey of fly-by-wire technology into aviation history is marked by significant milestones. The modified Vought F-8 Crusader,
crafted by NASA in 1972, holds the distinction of being the first aircraft entirely dependent on fly-by-wire systems in order to
stay airborn <a href="#Guilmartin"> (Guilmartin, 2003). </a> Notably, this innovation was not the first to utilize digital flight systems,
as the German V2 rocket, utilized gyroscopes to calculate acceleration and velocity <a href="#Ceruzzi"> (Ceruzzi, 2011) </a> <a href="#Guilmartin"> (Guilmartin, 2003). </a>.
The Apollo training vehicle emerged as the first aircraft devoid of mechanical backups, relying entirely on fly-by-wire technology.
Serving as a mock lunar lander for astronaut training, this vehicle played a crucial role in preparing astronauts for the
challenges of landing on the moon <a href="#Ian"> (Ian, 2017). </a> Not only could the system provide more nuanced control over a lander in an alien
environment, the reduction in weight was also significant in allowing the first lunar landing to take place. <a href="#Cradle">(Cradle of Aviation Museum, 2023) </a>

The fly-by-wire system offers a significant safety improvement by minimizing the risk of pilot error, particularly in challenging
situations that may lead to a loss of situational awareness. During critical moments, specific maneuvers could unintentionally
trigger unsafe outcomes, such as stalling the aircraft. To address this, the fly-by-wire system intervenes by actively
processing inputs from a distressed pilot, automatically blocking unsafe maneuvers, and prioritizing safety. <a href="#Nicolin">(Nicolin & Nicolin, 2019) </a> <a href="#Chudy">(Chudý, et al., 2009). </a>
Simultaneously, the fly-by-wire system enhances the comfort of passengers during turbulence. By analyzing the airflow at the front of the
plane, micro-adjustments are made to the control surfaces on the wings before turbulence reaches them, compensating for sudden drops
in lift <a href="#Nicolin">(Nicolin & Nicolin, 2019). </a> The Airbus A320 pioneered this approach in 1987, and since 1988, all Airbus vehicles, comprising
over 12,000 currently in operation, are equipped with fly-by-wire systems <a href="#Pierre">(Pierre, 2003) </a> <a href="#Airbus">(Airbus, 2023). </a>
A study comparing the removal of chord-shaped slices from a Boeing 747's horizontal stabilizer, with and without a fly-by-wire system,
demonstrated the critical role of this technology. Positioned at the back of the plane, the horizontal stabilizer provides stability by
counteracting the forward center of gravity <a href="#Benson">(Benson, 2021). (see <a href="#Figure"> Figure 1). </a>

Damage to the horizontal stabilizer can lead to aerodynamic imbalances and potential aircraft loss. The study concludes that without
fly-by-wire systems, removing half of the horizontal stabilizer renders the aircraft statically unstable. However, with the system in
place, the aircraft can endure stabilizer damage up to 60% before being deemed unsafe to fly <a href="#Dlamini">(Dlamini & Jones.T, 2016). </a>
While the study primarily explores one type of failure, further research is essential to enhance the system's robustness and adaptability
to different scenarios. Nonetheless, a 10% increase in controllability underscores the fly-by-wire system's viability in improving the
reliability and safety of commercial aircraft.

Furthermore, a second application of the fly-by-wire system lies in its contribution to the design of highly maneuverable aircraft, 
particularly relevant for fighter jets. Paired with an active control unit, the fly-by-wire system allows designers to create 
inherently unstable and un-aerodynamic planes, relying on computers to maintain flight. This approach aims to maximize maneuverability, 
enabling lighter aircraft and tighter turns <a href="#Appel">(Appel News, 2016). </a> This dual functionality positions the fly-by-wire system as a versatile 
and indispensable element in modern aviation technology.

<h2 id=Conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
  <pre>
The trajectory of aviation has been significantly altered by the advent and refinement of fly-by-wire technology. From its historical roots
in NASA's experimental aircraft to becoming a cornerstone of modern aviation safety, this system has demonstrated its transformative 
potential. The study assessing the impact of fly-by-wire on a Boeing 747's horizontal stabilizer underscores its pivotal role in 
maintaining aircraft stability and preventing catastrophic failures. Although the study focused on a specific failure scenario, 
the observed 10% increase in controllability suggests that fly-by-wire systems hold promise for improving reliability in various contexts.
Future research endeavors should aim to enhance the robustness of the system and its adaptability to diverse failure scenarios, 
ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and limitations. As aviation continues to evolve, fly-by-wire stands as a 
testament to innovation, ushering in an era of safer and more efficient air travel.
